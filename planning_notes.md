   - Face unexpected resistance
   - Send Kaito to gather intelligence
   - Receive reports about No-Man's Land activity

2. Update supporting documentation after Chapter 5
   - Update PROGRESS.md with completion status
   - Enhance World.md with new details about access tunnels
   - Update Characters.md with Varda's development

3. Commit all changes to GitHub before proceeding to Chapter 6

4. Continue development of subsequent chapters following enhanced outline
   - Chapter 6: Junction Points (Eli)
   - Chapter 7: Quantum Truths (Mara)

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

- Commit changes to GitHub after completing each chapter
- Update planning_notes.md with current development status after each chapter
- Create chapter-specific notes files for complex plot developments
- Maintain regular updates to PROGRESS.md
- Save work-in-progress versions of chapters periodically
