## Location Tracking

### The Mega-Dome
- **Sovereignty Sectors (1-7)**: Controlled by Nexus Sovereignty, most reliable life support
- **Freeport Collective (Sectors 8-11)**: Alliance of merchants and information brokers
- **Deep Warren (Sectors 12-17)**: Densely populated, resource-scarce region
- **HeliosTech Enclave (Sectors 18-20)**: Research-focused community maintaining advanced systems
- **The Junction (Central Hub)**: Where rail systems converge, controlled by rail-operators

### Key Facilities
- **The Lunar Relay Beacon**: Located on dome's outer perimeter, contains quantum computer core
- **Water Purification Facility**: In Sector 7, recently compromised in failed Sovereignty offensive
- **Rail System Control Center**: In The Junction, where Eli primarily works
- **Sovereignty Command Center**: In Sector 3, where Varda operates from
- **Freeport Collective Research Facility**: In Sector 9, where Mara meets with Ren in Ch. 10

### The No-Man's Land
- **Utopia's Ruins**: Collapsed dome visible on horizon, 3km from mega-dome
- **Research Station**: 3km from mega-dome's outer maintenance ring, where Mara retrieved data

## Plot Elements Tracking

### The Beacon's Nature and Capabilities
- Communication installation (official purpose)
- Contains control systems for orbital weapons platforms (revealed in Ch. 2)

   - Do environmental details align with established world-building?
   - Are distances and spatial relationships maintained?

4. **Plot Progression**:
   - Does the chapter advance the overall narrative logically?
   - Are revelations consistent with previously established facts?
   - Are foreshadowing elements being developed appropriately?

5. **Thematic Development**:
   - Is the philosophical exploration consistent with the character's perspective?

## Updates and Maintenance

This document will be updated after each chapter to incorporate new information, track character development, and ensure all narrative elements maintain consistency. When paired with the foreshadowing_payoff.md file, this creates a comprehensive system for maintaining narrative coherence throughout the remaining chapters.
