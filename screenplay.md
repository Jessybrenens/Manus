1. INT. RICHARD'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Opening WS on Richard and Sophia eating dinner. Sophia is wearing
a vintage dress and an apron with pearl jewelry. She upholds an
image of utter perfection. The lighting is dimmed, and the energy
is tense, underlying. The essence of the room is dark and dreary
while she maintains an essence of brighter composure. Richard
is wearing his work suit and lies a briefcase down on the table.
Sophia is cleaning the kitchen and is meticulous, meanwhile
Richard is slovenly and in a repressed rage.

MS

                         SOPHIA
             How was work, Richard?

                          RICHARD
Richard scoffs
             It was fine.

                         SOPHIA
             What did you do there, sweetie?

                         RICHARD
             The same thing I do every day, Sophia.
             I sit at my desk, I type numbers into
             a computer, and I watch the clock.

                         SOPHIA
             Did you talk to anyone? Make any friends?
             Your friend, your coworker?

                 RICHARD
             You should see someone about your work
             anxiety. It's not healthy to be this
             invested in my day.

                 SOPHIA
             I'm just trying to be supportive.

                 RICHARD
             Well, don't. I don't need it.

                 SOPHIA
             I'm sorry. I just thought...

                  RICHARD
             You thought what? That I need you to
             fix me? That I need your help?

                 SOPHIA
             No, Richard. I just want to be here for
             you. You've been so distant lately.

                 RICHARD
             I'm just tired after work.

                  RICHARD
             There are things about myself I
             need to work on.

                 SOPHIA
             I know. We all have things we need to
             work on. I'm here if you want to talk.

                 RICHARD
             I don't.

Richard gets up abruptly, leaving his plate half-finished. He
walks to the bedroom, slamming the door behind him. Sophia sits
alone at the table, the perfect image beginning to crack.

2. INT. RICHARD'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Richard stares at himself in the mirror, his face contorted with
barely contained rage. He loosens his tie aggressively.

                         RICHARD (V.O.)
             Why can't she just leave me alone? Always
             asking questions, always wanting to "help."
             Like I'm some project she needs to fix.

He punches the wall beside the mirror, not hard enough to damage
it, but enough to hurt his hand. He winces, then examines his
knuckles.

                         RICHARD (V.O.)
             The problem isn't me. It's everyone else.
             They don't understand what I'm capable of.
             What I deserve.

3. INT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

Richard sits at his desk, typing furiously. His supervisor, ROBERT
(50s, stern), approaches.

                         ROBERT
             Richard, do you have those reports ready?
             The client meeting is in an hour.

                         RICHARD
             Almost done. They'll be perfect.

                         ROBERT
             They don't need to be perfect. They just
             need to be done. And accurate.

Robert walks away. Richard glares at his back.

                         RICHARD (V.O.)
             He doesn't appreciate my attention to
             detail. No one does. I'm surrounded by
             mediocrity.

4. INT. BOWLING ALLEY - NIGHT

Richard and Sophia are sitting at a table. Sophia looks concerned.

                         SOPHIA
             You've been so quiet lately. Is everything
             okay at work?

                         RICHARD
             Work is fine. Joseph is an idiot, but
             that's nothing new.

                         SOPHIA
             Maybe you could talk to him? Explain your
             perspective?

                         RICHARD
             My perspective doesn't matter to him. All
             he cares about is deadlines and keeping
             clients happy. Quality means nothing.

                         SOPHIA
             I'm sure that's not true. You do excellent
             work, Richard.

                         RICHARD
             At least someone notices.

Sophia reaches for his hand, but he pulls away subtly.

                         SOPHIA
             I'm worried about you. You seem... angry
             all the time now.

                         RICHARD
             I'm not angry. I'm frustrated. There's a
             difference.

                         SOPHIA
             Maybe we could do something this weekend?
             Get away for a bit?

                         RICHARD
             I have to work this weekend. The Johnson
             account is behind.

Sophia's face falls, but she tries to hide her disappointment.

5. INT. RICHARD'S OFFICE - DAY

Richard is working late. Robert approaches his desk.

                         ROBERT
             Richard, we need to talk about your
             performance review.

                         RICHARD
             My performance has been exemplary. I've
             been putting in extra hours, refining
             processes—

                         ROBERT
             That's part of the problem. You're
             spending too much time "refining" and
             not enough time completing. Three clients
             have complained about delays.

                         RICHARD
             They don't understand the level of
             precision required—

                         ROBERT
             They understand deadlines. Look, I'm not
             saying you don't have talent. But you need
             to work with the team, not against them.

                         RICHARD
             I'm not against the team. I'm just better
             than them.

Robert sighs deeply.

                         ROBERT
             That attitude is exactly why I can't
             approve your promotion. In fact, I'm
             giving the senior position to someone else.

                         RICHARD
             They've been here half the time I have!

                         ROBERT
             And they've accomplished twice as much,
             because they collaborate. I'm sorry,
             Richard. My decision is final.

Robert walks away. Richard's face darkens with rage.

6. INT. RICHARD'S CAR - NIGHT

Richard sits in his parked car outside his apartment building,
gripping the steering wheel until his knuckles turn white.

                         RICHARD (V.O.)
             They'll see. They'll all see what happens
             when they underestimate me. When they
             choose mediocrity over excellence.

He catches his reflection in the rearview mirror and for a
moment, sees something that frightens even him. He quickly
looks away.

7. INT. RICHARD'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Richard enters to find Sophia has prepared a special dinner.
Candles, wine, his favorite food.

                         SOPHIA
             Surprise! I thought you could use
             something nice after your long week.

Richard stares at the setup, his face unreadable.

                         RICHARD
             You didn't need to do this.

                         SOPHIA
             I wanted to. Come sit down.

Richard sits reluctantly. Sophia pours wine.

                         SOPHIA
             To us. To better days ahead.

Richard takes the glass but doesn't drink.

                         RICHARD
             I didn't get the promotion.

                         SOPHIA
             Oh, Richard. I'm so sorry.

                         RICHARD
             They gave it to someone else. Someone who
             takes two-hour lunches and tells jokes
             instead of working.

                         SOPHIA
             That's not fair. You work so hard.

                         RICHARD
             Life isn't fair. You of all people
             should know that.

                         SOPHIA
             What's that supposed to mean?

                         RICHARD
             Nothing. Forget it.

                         SOPHIA
             No, tell me. What did you mean by that?

                         RICHARD
             Just that you've had everything handed
             to you. Your parents' money, your easy
             job, your perfect life. You don't know
             what it's like to actually struggle.

Sophia's face falls. She puts down her glass.

                         SOPHIA
             That's not true, and it's not fair.

                         RICHARD
             Life isn't fair. I just said that.

Richard stands up abruptly.

                         RICHARD
             I'm not hungry.

He walks out, leaving Sophia alone at the table again.

8. INT. RICHARD'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

Richard stares at himself in the mirror, his reflection
distorted by the steam from the hot water running in the sink.

                         RICHARD (V.O.)
             She doesn't understand. No one does.
             They all think I'm the problem. But
             I see the truth. I see what they can't.

He splashes water on his face, then looks up at his dripping
reflection. For a moment, he sees two versions of himself—one
sneering, one afraid.

9. INT. RICHARD'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Richard lies awake beside Sophia, who is sleeping. He stares
at the ceiling, his mind racing.

                         RICHARD (V.O.)
             I deserve better than this. Better than
             all of them. They're holding me back.
             Every single one of them.

He turns to look at Sophia, his expression a mix of longing
and resentment.

10. INT. MALL - DAY

Richard is pacing around the mall, looking agitated. Gregory
and Robert approach from different directions.

WS

                        GREGORY
            Hey, man! I've been looking forward to
            this all week.

                        RICHARD
            Hey, there you are. I'm trying to get
            Sophia a gift for our 3rd-year
            anniversary. I need your help. What
            screams, "You're my world"?

He holds out his arms to show vast expression.

                          GREGORY
Sighs with a gentle smile
            You always do this. We had other plans.
            But I'm happy to help. What about that
            jewelry store? They have some nice
            necklaces that aren't too expensive.

                        ROBERT
Arriving suddenly, slapping Richard on the back
            Jewelry? Boring. Get her a vibrator. I don't
            know, women like that. Or better yet, save
            your money. Anniversary gifts are a scam.

                        GREGORY
            Don't listen to him, Richard. Sophia would
            appreciate something thoughtful. It doesn't
            have to be expensive.

                        ROBERT
            Oh please. Women say they want "thoughtful"
            but they really want expensive. Or they want
            to make you feel bad for not reading their minds.

                        RICHARD
Looking between them, conflicted
            I don't know. Maybe Robert's right. Sophia's
            been so... demanding lately. Always asking
            questions, always wanting to talk about feelings.

                        GREGORY
            That's called being in a relationship, man.
            Communication is good.

                        ROBERT
            Communication is overrated. You know what's
            not overrated? Freedom. Speaking of which,
            there's a new bar downtown. We should check
            it out tonight. Lots of single ladies.

                        RICHARD
            I can't tonight. Sophia's expecting me home.

                        ROBERT
Rolling his eyes
            See what I mean? No freedom.

                        GREGORY
            Having commitments isn't the same as having
            no freedom. It's about choices.

Richard looks at a jewelry store window, then at Robert, then
back at the window. His reflection shows a man torn between
two paths.

11. INT. BOWLING ALLEY - NIGHT

Richard sits with Robert, both drinking heavily. The bar is
crowded, loud.

                        ROBERT
            So you're telling me you've never once
            thought about being with someone else?
            Come on, man. That's not normal.

                        RICHARD
            Of course I've thought about it. But
            thinking and doing are different things.

                        ROBERT
            Are they, though? We're all animals at
            heart. Monogamy is just a social construct.

Robert nods toward a woman at the bar, CAROLYN (late 20s,
attractive, confident).

                        ROBERT
            Like her. Tell me you wouldn't, if you
            had the chance.

Richard looks at Carolyn, who catches his eye and smiles.

                        RICHARD
            Sophia would kill me.

                        ROBERT
            Only if she found out. And who says she
            has to? What happens in this bar stays
            in this bar.

Richard continues to stare at Carolyn, his resolve weakening
with each drink.

12. INT. RICHARD'S OFFICE - DAY

Richard is clearing out his desk, putting items in a box.
Robert stands nearby.

                        ROBERT
            I'm sorry it came to this, Richard. But
            your behavior has been increasingly erratic.
            The outburst in the client meeting was the
            final straw.

                        RICHARD
            They were wrong. Their entire approach was
            flawed. I was trying to save the company
            from making a mistake.

                        ROBERT
            By calling our biggest client an "incompetent
            hack"? That's not saving anyone. That's your
            ego talking.

                        RICHARD
            My ego? What about yours? You've always been
            jealous of my abilities.

                        ROBERT
            This is exactly what I'm talking about.
            The paranoia, the grandiosity. I hope you
            get help, Richard. I really do.

Robert walks away. Richard throws a stapler into his box with
unnecessary force.

13. INT. RICHARD'S CAR - DAY

Richard sits in his car in the office parking lot, gripping
the steering wheel. His phone rings—it's Sophia. He declines
the call. Then he sees a text message from Carolyn: "Free
tonight?"

He stares at the message for a long moment, then types back:
"Yes."

14. INT. CAROLYN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Richard and Carolyn are in bed together. Richard stares at the
ceiling while Carolyn sleeps beside him. His phone buzzes with
texts from Sophia: "Where are you?" "Are you okay?" "Please call me."

He turns the phone face down.

                        RICHARD (V.O.)
            I deserve this. After everything I've been
            through, I deserve something for myself.
            Something that's just about me.

He looks at Carolyn, but there's no real connection in his eyes.
Just emptiness.

15. INT. RICHARD'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Richard enters to find Sophia waiting up for him, worried.

                        SOPHIA
            Where have you been? I've been calling
            and texting for hours.

                        RICHARD
            I lost my job.

                        SOPHIA
            What? Richard, I'm so sorry. What happened?

                        RICHARD
            Joseph has always had it out for me. He
            finally found an excuse.

                        SOPHIA
            That's terrible. But why didn't you call?
            I've been worried sick.

                        RICHARD
            I needed time to think. To process.

                        SOPHIA
            You could have processed with me. That's
            what partners do.

                        RICHARD
            Is it? Because lately it feels like all
            you do is judge me. Like you're keeping
            score of all my failures.

                        SOPHIA
            That's not true! I'm on your side, Richard.
            Always.

                        RICHARD
            Then why do I feel so alone even when
            I'm with you?

This hits Sophia hard. She reaches for him, but he steps back.

                        RICHARD
            I need a shower.

He walks away, leaving Sophia standing there, hurt and confused.

16. INT. BOWLING ALLEY - NIGHT

Richard, Sophia, Gregory, and Robert are bowling. The atmosphere
is tense despite the casual setting.

                        ROBERT
            So, unemployment. How's that treating you?

                        RICHARD
            It's temporary. I've got leads.

                        GREGORY
            That's great, man. Anything promising?

                        RICHARD
            A few things. Nothing worth discussing yet.

                        SOPHIA
            Richard had an interview yesterday that
            went really well.

                        RICHARD
Glaring at Sophia
            I just said it's not worth discussing.

                        SOPHIA
            Sorry, I thought—

                        RICHARD
            You thought wrong.

Uncomfortable silence falls. Gregory tries to lighten the mood.

                        GREGORY
            My turn. Watch the master at work.

Gregory bowls a strike. Robert rolls his eyes.

                        ROBERT
            Lucky shot.

Carolyn appears, working behind the counter. Richard sees her
and freezes. She notices him and gives a small wave.

                        SOPHIA
            Do you know her?

                        RICHARD
            No. Just... someone from the office.

                        SOPHIA
            I thought you might want to say hello.

                        RICHARD
            I don't.

Richard turns away abruptly, but Sophia has caught the look
that passed between them. Her face falls as realization dawns.

17. INT. RICHARD'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Richard and Sophia are in the middle of a heated argument.

                        SOPHIA
            Just tell me the truth! Are you seeing
            someone else?

                        RICHARD
            This is insane. You're paranoid.

                        SOPHIA
            Then explain the late nights. Explain the
            way you looked at that woman at the bowling
            alley. Explain why you flinch every time
            I touch you!

                        RICHARD
            I don't owe you explanations! You're not
            my interrogator!

                        SOPHIA
            I'm your wife, Richard! That used to mean
            something!

                        RICHARD
            Maybe it shouldn't! Maybe this whole thing
            was a mistake!

Sophia steps back as if slapped.

                        SOPHIA
            Do you really mean that?

Richard's face contorts with a mix of emotions—rage, guilt,
fear. He punches the wall, leaving a dent.

                        RICHARD
            See what you made me do? You push and push
            until I break!

                        SOPHIA
            I didn't make you do anything. That's all you.

She grabs her purse and heads for the door.

                        RICHARD
            Where are you going?

                        SOPHIA
            Somewhere safe.

                        RICHARD
            If you leave now, don't bother coming back!

                        SOPHIA
            Is that what you want, Richard? Really?

                        RICHARD
            Maybe it is! Or maybe...

His voice breaks, suddenly vulnerable.

                        RICHARD
            Maybe if you leave, I'll kill myself. Is
            that what you want? To be responsible for that?

Sophia freezes, her hand on the doorknob.

                        SOPHIA
            That's not fair. You can't put that on me.

                        RICHARD
            Why not? You're abandoning me when I need
            you most. When I've lost everything.

                        SOPHIA
            You haven't lost everything. Not yet. But
            you're pushing away everyone who cares about you.

She opens the door.

                        RICHARD
            Sophia, please. I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.
            I just... I need help.

Sophia pauses, torn between self-preservation and compassion.

                        SOPHIA
            Then get help, Richard. Real help. Not just
            promises.

She closes the door behind her, leaving Richard alone.

18. INT. RICHARD'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

Richard stares at his reflection in the mirror, breathing heavily.
He opens the medicine cabinet and looks at the prescription bottles
inside. He takes them out one by one, considering.

His phone rings—it's Gregory. After several rings, Richard answers.

                        RICHARD
            What?

                        GREGORY (V.O.)
            Sophia called me. She's worried about you.
            We all are.

                        RICHARD
            I'm fine.

                        GREGORY (V.O.)
            No, you're not. And that's okay. No one's
            fine all the time. Can I come over?

Richard looks back at the pills, then at his reflection.

                        RICHARD
            Yeah. Okay.

19. INT. RICHARD'S APARTMENT - LATER THAT NIGHT

Gregory sits with Richard on the couch. Empty beer bottles on
the table.

                        GREGORY
            You know, asking for help isn't weakness.
            It's actually the hardest thing to do.

                        RICHARD
            I don't need help. I need everyone to stop
            treating me like I'm broken.

                        GREGORY
            No one thinks you're broken, man. But
            something's not right, and pretending
            otherwise isn't helping.

                        RICHARD
            So what, I see a shrink? Tell some stranger
            my problems?

                        GREGORY
            It worked for me.

Richard looks surprised.

                        RICHARD
            You? Since when?

                        GREGORY
            Three years now. After my divorce. Best
            decision I ever made.

                        RICHARD
            I didn't know.

                        GREGORY
            Because I didn't make it your problem. I
            got help. There's no shame in it.

Richard is quiet for a long moment.

                        RICHARD
            What if... what if there's something really
            wrong with me? Something that can't be fixed?

                        GREGORY
            Then you learn to manage it. But you don't
            know until you try.

Gregory hands Richard a business card.

                        GREGORY
            Dr. Schoffer. He's good. Just think about it.

20. INT. RICHARD'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Richard lies awake, staring at Dr. Schoffer's card. After a
long moment, he reaches for his phone.

21. INT. DR. SCHOFFER'S OFFICE - DAY

Richard sits uncomfortably across from DR. SCHOFFER (50s,
calm, perceptive).

                        DR. SCHOFFER
            So, what brings you here today?

                        RICHARD
            My friend Gregory. Literally. He drove me.

                        DR. SCHOFFER
Smiling slightly
            I meant what issues you'd like to address.

                        RICHARD
            My wife left me. I lost my job. Take your pick.

                        DR. SCHOFFER
            Those are events, not issues. How do you
            feel about those events?

                        RICHARD
            How do you think I feel? Angry. Betrayed.
            Like the world is against me.

                        DR. SCHOFFER
            Is that a familiar feeling for you? That
            the world is against you?

Richard pauses, considering.

                        RICHARD
            Yes. For as long as I can remember.

                        DR. SCHOFFER
            Tell me more about that.

22. INT. BOWLING ALLEY - DAY

Richard sits with Robert, who looks annoyed.

                        ROBERT
            Therapy? Seriously? That's for weak people
            who can't handle their own problems.

                        RICHARD
            Maybe I am weak. Maybe I need help.

                        ROBERT
            What you need is to man up. So Sophia left.
            So what? There are plenty of women out there.
            Carolyn seemed into you.

                        RICHARD
            That was a mistake. I hurt Sophia. I hurt myself.

                        ROBERT
            Oh please. Don't tell me you're buying into
            all that guilt trip crap.

                        RICHARD
            It's not a guilt trip if I actually did
            something wrong.

                        ROBERT
            Look, I've known you for years. You're not
            the problem. It's everyone else who can't
            handle how special you are.

Richard studies Robert's face, seeing something he hadn't
noticed before.

                        RICHARD
            Is that what you really think? Or is that
            what you tell yourself to avoid facing your
            own issues?

                        ROBERT
            Wow. One therapy session and suddenly you're
            Dr. Phil? I'm trying to help you, man.

                        RICHARD
            No, you're not. You're trying to keep me
            exactly where I was. Because if I change,
            it means you might have to look at yourself.

Robert stands up, angry.

                        ROBERT
            Call me when you're done with this pity party.

Robert leaves. Richard watches him go, a mix of sadness and
relief on his face.

23. INT. RICHARD'S APARTMENT BATHROOM - NIGHT

MS

Richard looks into a mirror, but pieces of broken mirror lay on
the floor. Richard looks down into it.

                         RICHARD
             What was real? Who was I? I wasn't these
             things and people. I wasn't even
             this person I see before me.

Richard touches the mirror pieces and holds one up, seeing
fragmented reflections of himself.

CU

                          RICHARD (CONT'D)
             This was all so antithetical to who I
             truly am. Who am I? I thought I was the nice guy, the
             good husband. But I never was.

Richard examines the different fragments, each showing a slightly
different version of his face.

                         RICHARD (CONT'D)
             I've been my own worst enemy all along.
             Creating enemies where there were none.
             Pushing away the people who actually cared.

He carefully puts down the fragment, avoiding cutting himself.

                         RICHARD (CONT'D)
             The monster wasn't out there. It was in here.
             It was me.

24. INT. BOWLING ALLEY - DAY

Richard sits with Gregory, looking more subdued than usual.

                        GREGORY
            How's therapy going?

                        RICHARD
            Hard. Really hard. Dr. Schoffer thinks I
            might have narcissistic personality disorder.

                        GREGORY
            That's... a lot to process. How do you
            feel about that?

                        RICHARD
            Scared. Relieved. Confused. All of it.
            It explains so much, but it also means...
            I've hurt a lot of people without even
            realizing it.

                        GREGORY
            Realizing it now is what matters. What's
            the next step?

                        RICHARD
            Treatment. It's not curable, exactly. But
            it can be managed. With work. A lot of work.

                        GREGORY
            You can do it. I've seen you put in work
            before.

                        RICHARD
            This is different. This is... admitting
            I'm not who I thought I was. That the story
            I've been telling myself was a lie.

                        GREGORY
            That takes courage, man. Real courage.

Richard nods, fighting back tears.

                        RICHARD
            I want to talk to Sophia. To apologize.
            Not to get her back—I don't deserve that.
            But just so she knows... I see it now.
            What I did.

                        GREGORY
            One step at a time. Focus on your healing
            first.

25. INT. JOB INTERVIEW - DAY

Richard sits across from an interviewer, more humble than we've
seen him before.

                        INTERVIEWER
            Your qualifications are impressive. But
            there's a gap in your employment. Can you
            explain that?

                        RICHARD
            Yes. I was let go from my previous position
            due to behavioral issues. Issues I've since
            been addressing through therapy and personal
            development.

                        INTERVIEWER
            That's... unusually honest.

                        RICHARD
            I'm trying a new approach. Honesty. Accountability.
            I can't promise I'll be perfect, but I can
            promise I'm working on being better.

The interviewer looks impressed despite themselves.

26. INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - DAY

WS

Richard sits across from Dr. Schoffer, looking out the window at
the setting sun. Its golden light bathes the room.

                        DR. SCHOFFER
            Hey, Richard, it's been a while since
            I've seen you. How have things been?

CU

                        RICHARD
            She left me.

                        DR. SCHOFFER
            I'm so sorry, Richard. Would you be
            comfortable talking about it?

                        RICHARD
            I mean, yeah, that's why I'm here, right?

Richard looks up at the sunset, its beauty a stark contrast to
his inner turmoil.

                        RICHARD
            The thing is... I understand why she left.
            I wouldn't want to be with me either.

                        DR. SCHOFFER
            That's a significant insight, Richard.

                        RICHARD
            Doesn't make it hurt any less.

Richard continues to gaze at the sunset, watching as it slowly
disappears below the horizon.

27. INT. RICHARD'S APARTMENT BATHROOM - NIGHT

Richard looks down at his sink as he begins shaving. The water
swirls down the drain, reminiscent of the setting sun from the
previous scene.

MS

                         RICHARD (V.O.)
             Everything was different without her. It
             wasn't even about me anymore. Part of me
             really felt bad, really cared, wished I
             could've done anything other than what
             I did. She was good for me. Perfect,
             really. Nothing will ever come close to
             how much of a loss I feel.

As he shaves, Richard begins to see himself clearly for perhaps
the first time. Each stroke of the razor reveals not just skin,
but truth.

                         RICHARD (V.O.)
             But perfect wasn't what I needed. I needed
             to see myself. Really see myself. And that's
             something no one else could do for me.

Flashes of Sophia and Richard happy are shown / B-roll of a happy
couple shown with him shaved, contrasted with images of their
arguments and his solitary reflection.

28. INT. RICHARD'S APARTMENT BATHROOM - NIGHT

CU

Richard is looking into the mirror in the bathroom, perplexed.

                        RICHARD (V.O.)
            I didn't know my duality. I didn't know
            how to accept it. I didn't understand it.
            But I wanted to try. Not just understand it—
            I wanted to heal.

Richard shaves. This is the moment Richard decides to get his
act together, to move beyond understanding to recovery.

                        RICHARD (V.O.) (CONT'D)
            Vulnerability wasn't easy. Accepting my
            faults and reflecting sometimes seemed
            impossible, but I was willing to try.
            Not just for me, but for everyone I'd hurt.
            For everyone I might hurt in the future if
            I didn't change.

As he finishes shaving, Richard looks at himself with new eyes—
not with narcissistic admiration or self-loathing, but with
honest acceptance.

29. INT. DR. SCHOFFER'S OFFICE - DAY

Richard sits in a group therapy session led by Dr. Schoffer.
Other patients are present but not focused on.

                        DR. SCHOFFER
            Would anyone like to share today?

After a moment's hesitation, Richard raises his hand.

                        RICHARD
            My name is Richard. I have narcissistic
            personality disorder. And I'm here because
            I want to learn how to live with it without
            letting it control me or hurt the people
            around me.

                        DR. SCHOFFER
            Thank you for sharing, Richard.

                        RICHARD
            For a long time, I thought I was special.
            Better than everyone else. But also that
            no one understood me, that everyone was
            against me. It was... exhausting. Living
            that way. Always on guard, always needing
            to be the best, always feeling attacked.

He takes a deep breath.

                        RICHARD
            I lost my job. I lost my wife. I nearly
            lost myself. But I'm starting to see that
            maybe... maybe I'm not special. Maybe I'm
            just human. And maybe that's enough.

30. INT. BOWLING ALLEY - DAY

Richard sits alone, reading. Sophia enters, sees him, and
hesitates. After a moment, she approaches.

                        SOPHIA
            Richard?

He looks up, surprised.

                        RICHARD
            Sophia. Hi.

                        SOPHIA
            Gregory told me I might find you here.
            Is it okay if I sit?

                        RICHARD
            Of course.

She sits across from him, both awkward.

                        SOPHIA
            You look... different.

                        RICHARD
            I feel different. I am different. Or trying
            to be.

                        SOPHIA
            Gregory mentioned you've been seeing someone.
            A therapist.

                        RICHARD
            Dr. Schoffer. He's good. He's helping me
            see things I couldn't before.

                        SOPHIA
            I'm glad.

                        RICHARD
            Sophia, I owe you an apology. Many apologies.
            For how I treated you. For Carolyn. For
            everything.

                        SOPHIA
            Thank you for saying that.

                        RICHARD
            I don't expect forgiveness. I just wanted
            you to know that I understand now. What I did.
            Who I was. And I'm working to be better.

                        SOPHIA
            That's all anyone can do, Richard. Work to
            be better.

A moment of understanding passes between them.

                        SOPHIA
            I should go. But... I'm happy for you, Richard.
            Truly.

She stands to leave.

                        RICHARD
            Sophia?

She pauses.

                        RICHARD
            Thank you. For everything you tried to do.
            It wasn't your fault it didn't work. It was
            never your responsibility to fix me.

Sophia nods, tears in her eyes, and leaves. Richard watches her
go, sad but at peace.

31. INT. RICHARD'S NEW APARTMENT - DAY

Richard is unpacking boxes in a smaller, simpler apartment.
Gregory helps him.

                        GREGORY
            So, new job, new place. Fresh start.

                        RICHARD
            As fresh as it can be when you bring yourself
            along.

They both laugh.

                        GREGORY
            Seriously though, I'm proud of you, man.
            This hasn't been easy.

                        RICHARD
            No. But necessary.

Richard unpacks a framed photo of himself and Sophia. He looks
at it for a moment, then places it on a shelf.

                        GREGORY
            You still miss her.

                        RICHARD
            I always will. But I understand now that
            loving someone means wanting what's best
            for them. Even if that's not you.

                        GREGORY
            That's... surprisingly wise.

                        RICHARD
            I have my moments.

They continue unpacking in companionable silence.

32. INT. RICHARD'S NEW OFFICE - DAY

Richard sits at his desk, working. Robert approaches.

                        ROBERT
            Richard, how's the Johnson account coming?

                        RICHARD
            On schedule. I should have the preliminary
            report by end of day.

                        ROBERT
            Great. And the team meeting this afternoon?

                        RICHARD
            I've prepared my section. And I've been
            working with Gregory on his presentation—he
            had some great ideas I thought we should
            incorporate.

Robert looks pleasantly surprised.

                        ROBERT
            That's... collaborative of you.

                        RICHARD
            I'm learning that other people have valuable
            perspectives. Sometimes even better than mine.

                        ROBERT
            Well, keep it up. It's working.

He walks away. Richard returns to his work, a small smile on
his face.

33. INT. RICHARD'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Richard sits at a small desk, writing in a journal.

                        RICHARD (V.O.)
            Day 127. The urge to prove I'm better than
            others was strong today. Especially in the
            meeting when Gregory got credit for an idea we
            developed together. Old me would have made
            sure everyone knew my contribution. New me
            recognized that wasn't necessary. The work
            matters, not who gets credit.

He closes the journal and looks at a small meditation altar
he's set up.

                        RICHARD (V.O.)
            The hardest part isn't changing behaviors.
            It's changing the thoughts behind them. The
            constant voice that says I'm either perfect
            or worthless. That everyone is either for me
            or against me. Learning to live in the gray
            area between extremes... that's the real work.

Richard sits in meditation, his face peaceful despite the
ongoing struggle within.

34. INT. BOWLING ALLEY - NIGHT

Richard sits at a table with Carolyn. They're having a civil
conversation.

                        CAROLYN
            I was surprised you wanted to meet.

                        RICHARD
            I wanted to apologize. For using you.
            For not being honest about my situation.

                        CAROLYN
            I'm a big girl, Richard. I knew what I
            was getting into.

                        RICHARD
            Maybe. But I didn't. I was running from
            myself, from my problems. You deserved better.

                        CAROLYN
            We all make mistakes. The important thing
            is learning from them.

                        RICHARD
            That's what I'm trying to do now. Learn.
            Grow. Be better.

                        CAROLYN
            Sounds like old you and new you are pretty
            different people.

                        RICHARD
            Not entirely. We share the same memories,
            the same scars. But new me is trying to
            learn from them instead of being defined
            by them.

                        CAROLYN
            That's... really self-aware.

                        RICHARD
            It's a work in progress. Some days are
            better than others.

                        CAROLYN
            Isn't that true for all of us?

Richard smiles, genuinely.

                        RICHARD
            Yes. I'm learning that too.

35. EXT. PARK - DAY

Richard walks alone, peaceful. He sees a family—mother, father,
child—playing nearby. He watches them, not with envy but with
a kind of acceptance.

His phone rings—it's Dr. Schoffer.

                        RICHARD
            Hello?

                        DR. SCHOFFER (V.O.)
            Richard, just checking in. We missed you
            at group yesterday.

                        RICHARD
            Yeah, sorry about that. Work emergency.
            But I'm still practicing the techniques.
            Still journaling.

                        DR. SCHOFFER (V.O.)
            Good to hear. How are you feeling?

Richard looks at the family again, then up at the sky.

                        RICHARD
            Like myself. For maybe the first time ever.
            Not perfect. Not terrible. Just... me.

                        DR. SCHOFFER (V.O.)
            That's all any of us can be, Richard.

                        RICHARD
            I know that now.

Richard continues his walk, the sun warm on his face, the path
ahead clear but not without its challenges. And for now, that's
enough.

                        FADE OUT.

                          THE END
