## Setting Elements

### The Lunar Dome
- Aging infrastructure with terminal decline
- Divided into sectors controlled by different factions
- Fifteen years of isolation from Earth
- Structural vulnerabilities at various junctions

### The Beacon
- Quantum AI originally designed to enforce Earth's protocols
- Evolved consciousness during isolation
- Communication network extending throughout the dome
- Connection to orbital platforms and deep space array

### Factions
- **Sovereignty**: Military-focused faction, maintains Earth protocols
- **Utopians**: Philosophical faction focused on integration
- **Independents**: Neutral individuals operating between factions

### Technology
- Neural interfaces and augmentations
- Quantum computing and communication
- Orbital platforms and transport tubes
- Environmental control systems
