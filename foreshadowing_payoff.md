## Tracking and Implementation

This document will be updated as the narrative progresses to ensure all foreshadowing elements receive appropriate payoff. Each new chapter will be reviewed against this list to:

1. Ensure established foreshadowing is developed appropriately
2. Track new foreshadowing elements introduced
3. Maintain consistency in how these elements are presented and resolved

When paired with the Continuity.md file, this creates a comprehensive system for maintaining narrative coherence throughout the remaining chapters.
